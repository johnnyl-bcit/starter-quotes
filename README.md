## starter-quotes

This project is the starting repository for COMP4711 (fall 2017) lab #2.

This is a very basic CodeIgniter webapp, provided not to teach you everything
about CodeIgniter, but instead to provide an excuse to collaborate
on a few improvements to it.

It uses some starter files and CodeIgniter components that you will learn
properly over the weeks to come :-/

Configure your web server or virtual host so that the appropriate
document root maps to the **public** folder inside the folder you clone
this repository to.
